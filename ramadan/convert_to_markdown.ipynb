      "Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, begins and ends with the sighting of the moon. The start of Ramadan is marked by the sighting of the crescent moon (hilal), signifying the end of the previous month, Sha'ban. Similarly, Ramadan ends with the sighting of the crescent moon that marks the beginning of Shawwal, the month following Ramadan. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: I believe (though not 100% sure of the reference) there is a hadith that says: \"Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Sha'ban. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then fast thirty days.\" This hadith emphasizes the importance of moon sighting in determining the beginning and end of Ramadan. However, in modern times, due to differences in moon sighting and the use of astronomical calculations, there can be variations in the start and end dates of Ramadan across different countries and communities.\n",
      "                    \n",
      "\n",
      "### Followup: Should I follow the moon sighting as per the sunnah, or follow the astronomical calculation method? For context, my local masjid follows the calculation method.\n",
      "                            \n",
      "### Followup Answer\n",
      "The issue of whether to follow moon sighting (rukyah) or astronomical calculations for determining the beginning of Ramadan is a matter of scholarly debate within the Sunni tradition. Both methods have their proponents among respected scholars, and the difference in opinion stems from interpretations of Islamic texts and the application of Islamic legal principles. 1. **Moon Sighting (Rukyah):** This method is based on the hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), which emphasizes physical moon sighting as the criterion for beginning and ending the fasting month of Ramadan. Scholars who advocate for this method include classical scholars such as Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal and Imam Shafiee, who stress adherence to the hadith and the tradition of physical moon sighting. 2. **Astronomical Calculations:** Some contemporary scholars argue that astronomical calculations can be used to determine the Islamic months, including Ramadan, as they provide precise and unified results. Scholars like Yusuf Al Qaradawi and Muhammad Shinqeeti support the use of calculations under the principle of facilitating ease for Muslims and achieving unity among Muslim communities, especially in regions where moon sighting is difficult due to weather conditions or geographical factors. Given that your local masjid follows the calculation method, it is important to consider the concept of unity and cooperation within the Muslim community. Imam Shafiee mentioned the importance of unity and following the community, especially in matters of worship that involve communal participation, like the start of Ramadan and Eid prayers. If you are in a community where the calculation method is followed, participating in unity with your community can be seen as a valid approach, especially if it is endorsed by trusted local scholars. However, it is also important to respect and understand the diversity of opinions within the Islamic tradition on this matter. Engaging in respectful dialogue and seeking knowledge about the different perspectives can enrich your understanding and help maintain harmony within the Muslim community.\n",
