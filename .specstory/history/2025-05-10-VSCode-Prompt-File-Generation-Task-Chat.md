# VSCode Prompt File Generation Task Chat (2025-05-10 20:52:20)

Dev. Note: the empty code block sections you see below is an issue in how VSCode copies entire chat conversations (so hopefully it will get corrected in the future).
* So btw, if you don't see these empty code blocks in the `#file:2025-05-10-Conversion-Task-Chat.md ` file, then that's because I manually filled in these code blocks for that file in order for you to visualize what the original output of the VSCode agent looked like `:]`.

See this file? #file:2025-05-10-Conversion-Task-Chat.md 

I want you to understand this chat.

Then understand the "Prompt Files" VSCode feature mentioned here: #fetch : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_prompt-files-experimental

Then, as mentioned in the docs URL provided above, create a `.github/prompts/` folder , and add 3 files (follow the syntax structure mentioned in the URL above). These 3 files are:

* qta-convert-to-sub-quiz-from-html.prompt.md
* qta-generate-sub-quiz-from-book-content.prompt.md
* qta-update-the-whole-quiz

Note 1: `qta` stands for `Quran Tadabbor Wa Aamal`

Note 2: You should infer yourself what the tasks to be executed in the 3 above files are , based on what you understand from #file:2025-05-10-Conversion-Task-Chat.md

I'll analyze the chat conversation in the provided file and create prompt files based on the VSCode "Prompt Files" feature. Let me break this down step by step. 

Now I'll examine the VSCode "Prompt Files" feature as mentioned in the provided URL: 

Now I need to create a `.github/prompts` folder structure and create three prompt files based on the understanding from the conversation.

First, let me check if the `.github` folder exists already: 

Great, now I'll create the three prompt files based on the understanding of the conversation:

1. First, let's create the prompt file for converting HTML quiz questions to Markdown: 

2. Next, let's create the prompt file for generating quiz questions from book content: 



3. Finally, let's create the prompt file for updating the whole quiz: 



Let me verify that all three files have been created successfully: 

I've successfully created the three prompt files for the Quran Tadabbor Wa Aamal project based on my understanding of the chat conversation. Here's a summary of what I've done:

1. Created the `` directory structure as specified in the VSCode documentation.

2. Created three prompt files following the required format with headers (Front Matter) and detailed prompts:

   - **qta-convert-to-sub-quiz-from-html.prompt.md**
     - Purpose: Converts quiz questions from HTML format to Markdown format
     - Key tasks: Extract questions from HTML, format with proper Arabic/RTL support, ensure 4 options per question, add correct answer sections
     - This corresponds to the first task seen in the chat where HTML questions were converted to Markdown

   - **qta-generate-sub-quiz-from-book-content.prompt.md**
     - Purpose: Generates new quiz questions based on book content paragraphs
     - Key tasks: Create 10 MCQs with 4 options each, add them to both MD and CSV files, ensure proper formatting
     - This corresponds to the second major task in the chat where new questions were generated from book content

   - **qta-update-the-whole-quiz.prompt.md**
     - Purpose: Consolidates all sub-quizzes into the main comprehensive quiz files
     - Key tasks: Merge content from multiple sub-quiz files into main files, update table of contents, maintain consistent formatting
     - This corresponds to the final FYI note in the chat about your organization strategy

Each prompt file includes detailed instructions, required formatting, and step-by-step processes to ensure consistent results when used. They also use the ${input:variableName} syntax as specified in the VSCode documentation to allow for dynamic input when the prompts are used.

These prompt files should now be accessible through VS Code's prompt system by typing `/` followed by the prompt name in the chat input, or by using the "Chat: Run Prompt" command.

ok, but 3 updates please:

first update: In this file #file:qta-update-the-whole-quiz.prompt.md  , update the logic of the prompt so that it does this consolidation based ono the numbers that the user provides when running the prompt file.
* e.g., if when running the prompt file in vscode they pass `1, 2` , then we check and consolidate the .md/.csv files of sub-quizzes 1 and 2 , etc.
* Moreover, if they don't pass any extra args , then assume the whole md/csv is updated UNTIL the last sub-quiz, so just check and consolidate the last sub-quiz number.


Second update: in the #file:qta-convert-to-sub-quiz-from-html.prompt.md  file, change the prompt's logic so that instead of just adding to a .md file, we add to the respective .csv file as well (like the output logic mentioned in #file:qta-generate-sub-quiz-from-book-content.prompt.md  )

Third update: In all of the 3 .prompt.md files that you created, i want you to change the logic of the expected user input to the following:

* In #file:qta-convert-to-sub-quiz-from-html.prompt.md  , don't expect any `${input:...}` parameters, as the following will happen instead: before the user runs this prompt, they will create a `quiz-x.html` file, then, this prompt will automatically pick up the html file in `sub-quizzes/` dir. with the latest `x` suffix, then generate/update the equivalent `quiz-x.md` x.csv`files. Note: logically, `x` is the last suffix found in `sub-quizzes/` plus `1`.

* Similar logic for #file:qta-generate-sub-quiz-from-book-content.prompt.md ; we expect the user to have first created a `book-content-x.md` file, then `quiz-x.md` x.csv` files will be generated/updated accordingly.

* Finally, for #file:qta-update-the-whole-quiz.prompt.md  , we'll always update these 2 files: #file:quran-tadabbor-wa-aamal-quiz.md / #file:quran-tadabbor-wa-aamal-quiz.csv  , so no need to pass them as  `${input:...}` . Instead, what will be taken as user input is mentioned to you in the `first update:` paragraph that I wrote to you above.

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the three prompt files according to your requests. Let me make these changes one by one.

### First Update: Modifying `qta-update-the-whole-quiz.prompt.md`

Let me first read the current content of this file: 

Now I'll update this file based on your request: 

I'll need to use the create_file tool to update this file since replace_string_in_file is not working correctly: 

Let me try using insert_edit_into_file instead: 
````

````




### Second Update: Modifying `qta-convert-to-sub-quiz-from-html.prompt.md`

Let me read the current content first: 



Now I'll update this file according to your requests: 
````

````






### Third Update: Modifying `qta-generate-sub-quiz-from-book-content.prompt.md`

Let me read the current content first: 



Now I'll update the file: 
````

````






Let's verify all the changes: 

 



I've successfully updated all three files as requested. Here's a summary of the changes:

### 1. Updated `qta-update-the-whole-quiz.prompt.md`
- Modified to handle specific quiz numbers provided by the user
- Added logic to determine which sub-quizzes to consolidate:
  - If specific numbers are provided (e.g., "1, 2, 5"), it will use those numbers
  - If no numbers are provided, it will find and use only the latest sub-quiz
- Removed references to input parameters for file paths, and instead hardcoded the main quiz file paths
- Added the list_dir tool to help find the latest quiz files

### 2. Updated `qta-convert-to-sub-quiz-from-html.prompt.md`
- Added functionality to automatically find the latest HTML quiz file in the sub-quizzes directory
- Modified to generate both MD and CSV files (not just MD as before)
- Added detailed instructions for CSV file format with category, question, options, and correct answer
- Removed the ${input:...} parameters since file detection is now automatic
- Added the list_dir and file_search tools to help find the latest files

### 3. Updated `qta-generate-sub-quiz-from-book-content.prompt.md`
- Added automatic detection of the latest book-content-X.md file
- Modified to create or update the corresponding quiz-X.md and quiz-X.csv files
- Maintained the requirement to randomize option order in questions
- Added detailed instructions for CSV file formatting
- Removed the ${input:...} parameters since file detection is now automatic
- Added the list_dir and file_search tools to help find the latest files

All three prompt files now follow a consistent pattern of automatically detecting the relevant files and generating their outputs without requiring explicit input parameters, which makes them more user-friendly in VS Code.
